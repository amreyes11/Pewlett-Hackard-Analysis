Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

#Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the new analysis is well defined.
Bobby has been given additional assignments now that SQL is better understood:  we will determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  The analysis will prove the "silver tsunami" as the manager prepares for current employees to retire.  


#Results:
There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
*  The retirement table will show employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
*  According to the findings, a high percentage of the employees are eligible to retire at any given time.  
*  The breakdown of the job titles based on eligible retires is as follows:  
*   Senior Engineer:    25916
*   Senior Staff:       24926
*   Engineer:           9285
*   Staff:              7636
*   Technique Leader:   3603
*   Assistant Engineer: 1090
*   Manager:            2


#Summary:

More than 70,000 roles will require filling as soon as ppossible as the workforce is eligible for retirement.

Based on the mentorship program, there are currently 1,940 emplyees are who eligible.  It does not appear to be enough qualified retirment-ready employees to train the next generation.
